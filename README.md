# Test Scenarios for Facebook Sign-up

## Overview

This project comprises test scenarios for the Facebook sign-up functionality. The purpose is to analyze the functionality of the Sign Up feature on Facebook's website as a part of the planning phase before conducting actual testing. The content of these test scenarios does not involve real testing and serves as an exercise derived from my learning journey. The primary objective is to practice thinking critically and analyzing user actions that may impact the system.
